/*
When the user clicks on the Play Game button you need to simulate an entire season.

You will first create an array of team objects for each team displayed on the html form in the WCC group.

Each team will play the other team 2 times, once as the home team and once as the visitor. 
The home team gets an extra 5 points. You will generate random numbers for each of the teams from 0 to 100. 
If there is a tie, you will play an overtime that generates a new random number score up to 15 points. 
This score will be added to the previous score. Do NOT add the extra bonus of 5 points for home teams during the overtime portion. 
If there is another tie, do another overtime period generating 2 new random numbers and adding it to the total score. 
Keep doing this until there is no tie.

When the game is over you will update the totalPointsFor and the totalPointsAgainst attributes 
by calling the methods (NOT using the attribute).

You will also update the wins and the losses for each team as a game is completed. 
You will call the calcWinLossPct method to update the winLossPct attribute.

You will also need to add a new game object to the games attribute for the team and make sure the constructor 
is appropriately called to populate myScore, theirScore, and winOrLoss.

Each team will play the other teams in the list 2 times but they will not play each other more than that.

Once the season is over you will sort the arrays based upon the wins and display all of the teams 
dynamically to the output "p" tag.

Make sure you use arrays of objects. Make sure you add appropriate comments. 
The assignment requirements are worth 90% so go the extra mile and make it look good for the extra 10 points.

Only 1 per team needs to be submitted. Do NOT submit more than that. 
Only people that worked on the project get their name in the submission box for the group.
